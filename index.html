<h2>About</h2>
<p>Coding is something that makes a difference. When you code, you get this feeling that you are helping people. Through code you can create something that people interact with, use, touch and work with. When you manage to build something that solves problems, you know that you are making a difference in someone else's life. That is an amazing feeling</p>
